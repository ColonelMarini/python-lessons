First off, thanks for teaching all of us now lets get started.

Ok, A little bit about myself, well I'm 14, live in Florida U.S. want to be in the military (specificlly Air Force//zoomies :P).
How do I learn, umm, thats hard to say, but I normally can learn equally well by reading or someone teaching it to me by voice or typing it live.
As for my math skills, I'm in algerbra 1 honors, and not doing so well... but thats probably due to lack of effort, so I can most likley do something if I put my mind to it.
As for what I want to achieve in programming that goes back to the Air Force as they are the military division in charge of cyberspace so thats why I'm taking this course and going to crooms.
Now, how can you help me? Well I normally skim-read or accidently skip parts of text when the messages are long so if I mis-read or forget a step just be patient with me as I fumble to figure it out.

I think thats everything :)
